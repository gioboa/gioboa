I'm a t-shaped developer and the front-end ecosystem is my passion.<br>
I started to develop application in 2006 and in 2012 I fall in love with JavaScript.<br>
I'm also active in open source ecosystem, I love learn and study new things.<br>
I'm very ambitious and I try to improve myself every day. :rocket:
